Hey there! I'm a UWO Compsci major in Canada.
Admittedly I'm currently pretty bad at programming, so I'm here mainly to learn. Hopefully at some point I'll be able to start helping others.

Right now I'm trying to learn web dev with springboot, html, and MySQL. If you somehow stumble across my profile feel free to give me tips! They're much appreciated.
